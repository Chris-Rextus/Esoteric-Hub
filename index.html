                <p>Have you ever wondered if God exists? Which is the best way of handling the burden of life? Why are the US inflation-corrected salaries frozen since the 70s, or even why is government bureaucracy full of P________?

                        <p>The perspectives on magic are divided in basically two: The normie wicca that plays with rituals to attract her beloved Mr.Chad Chadigton McThunderCock, and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/" target="_blank">/r/Atheism</a> midwit who thinks he's very cool by cursing churches all day. And even though those living-proofs of Dunning-Krueger effect obfuscate the discussion, the topic is actually very profound and frutiferous to explore.</p>
